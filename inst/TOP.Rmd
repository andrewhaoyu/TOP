abstract: "	Cancers are routinely classified into subtypes according to various features, including histo pathological characteristics and molecular markers. Genomic investigations have reported heterogeneous association between loci and cancer subtypes. However, it is not evident what is the optimal modeling strategy for handling correlated tumor features, missing data, and increased degrees-of-freedom in the underlying tests of associations. In this tutorial, we proposed a two-stage polytomous regression framework to handle cancer data with multivariate tumor characteristics. In the first stage, a standard polytomous model is used to specify for all subtypes defined by the cross-classification of different markers. In the second stage, the subtype-specific case-control odds ratios are specified using a more parsimonious model based on the case-control odds ratio for a baseline subtype, and the case-case parameters associated with tumor markers. Further, to reduce the degrees-of-freedom, we allow to specify case-case parameters for additional markers using a random-effect model. We use the EM algorithm to account for missing data on tumor markers. The score-test distribution theory is developed by borrowing analogous techniques from group-based association tests. Through simulations across a range of realistic scenarios, we show the proposed methods outperforms alternative methods for identifying heterogenous associations between risk loci and tumor subtypes."

# Overview
This vegnette provides an introduction to the 'TOP' package. To load the package, users need to install package from CRAN and TOP from github. The package can be loaded with the following command:
```{r, include=T}
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)  
#install_github("andrewhaoyu/TOP")
library(TOP)
```

# Two-stage polytomous model
In this vegnette, we will decomstrate the methods with a breast cancer example. There are around 5,112 cases and 4,888 controls in the dataset. Four different tumor characteristics were included: ER (positive vs negative), PR (positive vs negative), HER2 (positive vs negative), grade (ordinal 0, 1, 2). 

For simplicity, we will first demonstrate the two-stage model with three binary tumor characteristics (ER, PR, and HER2). These three tumor characteristics could define 8 different breast cancer subtypes (8=2x2x2). We included two covariates, one is a SNP that we are interested. The second one is the first principal component (PC1). 
Let $D_{i}$ denote the disease status, taking values in $\{0,1,2,\cdots,8\}$, of the $i$th ($i \in 1, \cdots, 10,000$) subject in the study. $D_{i}=0$ represents a control, and $D_{i}=m$ represent a subject with disease of 
subtype $m$. Let $G_i$ be the genotype for $i$th subject  and $X_i$ be the PC1 for the $i$th subject.
In the first-stage model, we use the standard ``saturated'' polytomous logistic regression model
$$ Pr(D_{i}=m|G_i,X_{i})=\frac{\exp(\beta_m G_i+\eta_m X_i)}{1+\sum_{m=1}^{8}\exp(\beta_m G_i+\eta_{m}X_{i})}$$
where $\beta_{m}$ and $\eta_{m}$ are the regression coefficients for the SNP and PC1 for association with the $m$th subtype. 

Because each cancer subtype $m$ is defined through a unique combination of the 3 characteristics, we can always
alternatively index the parameters $\beta_m$ as $\beta_{s_1s_2s_3}$, where 
$s_1,s_2,s_3\in\{0,1\}$ for the three binary tumor characteristics. Originally $\beta_1$ could be the coefficient of cancer subtype ER-PR-HER2-. With the new index, $\beta_1$ could be written as $\beta_{000}$, which means the ER, PR, HER2 are all negative. With this new index, we can represent the log odds ratio as
$$\beta_{s_{1}s_{2}s_{3}}=\theta^{(0)}+\theta_{1}^{(1)}s_{1}+\theta_{2}^{(1)}s_{2}+\theta_{3}^{(1)}s_{3}+\theta_{12}^{(2)}s_{1}s_{2}+\theta_{13}^{(2)}s_{1}s_{3}+\theta_{23}^{(2)}s_{2}s_{3}
+\theta_{123}^{(3)}(s_{1}s_{2}s_{3}).$$
Here $\theta^{(0)}$ represents the standard case-control log odds ratio for a reference disease subtype compared to the control. $\theta_{k}^{(1)}$ represents a case-case log odds ratio associated with the levels of $k$th tumor characteristics after
adjusting for other tumor characteristics. We also refer $\theta_{k}^{(1)}$ as the main effect of the $k$th tumor characteristic. And $\theta_{k_1k_2}^{(2)}$
represents how the case-case log odds ratio associated $k_1$th tumor characteristic is modified by the levels of the $k_2$th tumor characteristic and vice versa. We also refer $\theta_{k_1k_2}^{(2)}$ as the pairwise interaction between the $k_1$th and $k_2$th tumor characteristic. And $\theta_{123}^{(3)}$ represent the third order interactions of the three tumor characteristics. This decomposition is equivalent with the first stage model. Since both the first stage and second stage have 8 parameters. We called this saturated model. The users could construct different two-stage model by assuming different second stage parameters to be 0. For example, the baseline only model:
$$\beta_{s_{1}s_{2}s_{3}}=\theta^{(0)}.$$
This model assumes all of the subtypes have the same log odds ratio. So it is equivalent to the standard logistic regression. 
We can also construct the additive two-stage model by assuming all of the second stage interactions parameters are 0, then the second stage decomposition becomes,
$$\beta_{s_{1}s_{2}s_{3}}=\theta^{(0)}+\theta_{1}^{(1)}s_{1}+\theta_{2}^{(1)}s_{2}+\theta_{3}^{(1)}s_{3}$$
Furthermore, we could construct the pairwise interaction two-stage model by assuming all of the second stage higher order interactions parameters are 0, then the second stage decomposition becomes,
$$\beta_{s_{1}s_{2}s_{3}}=\theta^{(0)}+\theta_{1}^{(1)}s_{1}+\theta_{2}^{(1)}s_{2}+\theta_{3}^{(1)}s_{3}+\theta_{12}^{(2)}s_{1}s_{2}+\theta_{13}^{(2)}s_{1}s_{3}+\theta_{23}^{(2)}s_{2}s_{3}$$

# Two-stage polytomous model self design second stage
Instead of using the hierarchical second stage decomposition we discussed in last section, the two-stage model also allows the user to self design the second stage matrix. For example, we could define five intrinsic breast cancer subtypes based on the four tumor characteristics: ER, PR, HER2, grade. The five intrinsic subtypes are: 1. (ER or PR)+, HER2-, grade 1 or 2; 2. (ER or PR)+, HER2+; 3. (ER or PR)+, HER2-, grade 3; 4. (ER & PR)-, HER2-; 5. ER-PR-HER2-. We are interested in estimating the case-control log odds ratios of these intrinsic subtypes.

# Fixed effect two-stage model score test (FTOP)
To construct the score test for a fixed effect two stage model, we need two steps. First, we need to fit the model under the null hypothesis that the second stage parameters of SNP is 0. In other words, null of the subytpes is associated with the SNP. Second we need should compute the score and information matrix for each SNP.
Based on the score and information matrix, we could construct the score test statistics for global association test
```{r, echo=T,cache=T}
#fit the two-stage model under the null hypothesis
#that the second stage parameters of SNP is 0
#the model only has one covariate PC1
score.support.fixed <- ScoreTestSupportMixedModel(y=y,
                                                  additive=PC1,
                                                  missingTumorIndicator=888)


#Generate the additive second stage design matrix
z.additive <- cbind(1,z.standard)
#compute the score and information matrix for SNP
score.test.fixed <- ScoreTestMixedModel(y=y,
                                        x=SNP,
                                        z.design = z.additive,
                                        score.test.support=score.support.fixed,
                                        missingTumorIndicator=888)
#the first element is the score
#the second element is the information matrix
score.fixed <- score.test.fixed[[1]]
infor.fixed <- score.test.fixed[[2]]
#compute the global association test p value
p.value.ftop <- DisplayFixedScoreTestResult(score.fixed,infor.fixed) 
print(p.value.ftop)
```





# Mixed effect two-stage model score test (MTOP)
To construct the score test for a mixed effect two stage model, we need four steps. First, we need to fit the model under the null hypothesis that the second stage parameters of SNP is 0. In other words, null of the subytpes is associated with the SNP. Second, we need should compute the score and information matrix of fixed effect for each SNP. Then, we need to fit the model under the null that the variance of random effect is 0. Finally, we need to compute the score and information matrix of the random effect terms. With the score and information of fixed effect and random effect, we could construct the global association test for the mixed effect two-stage model.

```{r, echo=T,cache=T}
#we are going to build a two-stage model with 
#baseline parameter and ER case-case parameter as fixed
#We assume the PR, HER2, grade case-case parameter 
#to be random
#fit the two-stage model under the null hypothesis
#that the second stage parameters of SNP is 0
#the model only has one covariate PC1
#Generate the z design matrix for fixed effect
z.design.fixed <- cbind(1,z.standard[,1])
#compute the score and information matrix for fixed effect
score.test.fixed <- ScoreTestMixedModel(y=y,
                    x=SNP,
                    z.design=z.design.fixed,
                    score.test.support=score.support.fixed,
                    missingTumorIndicator=888)
#the first element is the score
#the second element is the information matrix
score.fixed <- score.test.fixed[[1]]
infor.fixed <- score.test.fixed[[2]]

#fit the two-stage model under the null hypothesis
#that only the random effect is 0
#the model will have two covariates, 
#PC1 and the fixed effect of SNP
score.support.random <- ScoreTestSupportMixedModelSelfDesign(y=y,
                        x.self.design  = SNP,
                        z.design = z.design.fixed,
                        additive = PC1,
                        missingTumorIndicator = 888)
#Generate the z design matrix for random effect
#PR, HER2 and grade is random effect
z.design.random <- z.standard[,2:4]

#compute the score and information matrix for random effect
score.test.random <- ScoreTestMixedModel(y=y,
                                         x=SNP,
                                         z.design=z.design.random,
                                         score.test.support=score.support.random,
                                         missingTumorIndicator=888)
#the first element is the score
#the second element is the information matrix
score.random <- score.test.random[[1]]
infor.random <- score.test.random[[2]]

#after we get the the fixed effect score, infor 
#and random effect score, infor, 
#we can combine them through the following function. 
#two p value will be generated.
#the first p value for global association test.
#the second p value is for the null hypothesis 
#that random effect is 0
#Under this situation, the second p value is NOT 
#the global heterogeneity test p value since ER is fixed
p.value.mtop <- DisplayMixedScoreTestResult(
  score.fixed,
  infor.fixed,
  score.random,
  infor.random
)  
print(p.value.mtop)
